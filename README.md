# Credit Risk Intern
This project was done during my Practice School-I from May to July 2016, when I was an intern in Indain Bank, Chennai. I created the
risk model which aims at minimizing the credit risk incurred in the bank. Trained the model with the supervised classification technique
called Decision trees. Based on the previous data of the customers and their loan details, this risk model predicts whether to give any
customer a loan or not. Also, the model was evaluated with classification accuracy and confusion matrix. I also explore the behavior of
results obtained with the depth of a decision tree. I had aslo given a short presentation about the decision tree working and useful 
results obtained from the work, to the Indian Bank employees and my mentor. 

Decision trees with depth=3 and depth=4 have been included here. The data.csv file contains the data about the loan details of the 
customers. 
The code.py contains the code which helps in training model using decision trees classifier, and also helps in plotting the graphical image 
of decision trees. The code also cleans the data first, make data ready for applying any machine learning algorithm. Cleaning the data means
dealing with missing values, removing duplicates, etc. The obtained decision trees can be used by the organization to conclude a particular
decision. The accuracy of the model and confusion matrices have been shown and calculated in the report of this project. The report can be 
found over [here.](http://ubermankapil.github.io/report.PDF)
